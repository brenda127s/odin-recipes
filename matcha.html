    <h2>What is matcha?</h2>
    <p>Before getting into the recipe, let me provide some context on matcha. Originating in Japan during the 110s, this green tea powder plays a central role in traditional Japanese tea cerimonies. Crafted from shade-grown green tea leaves finely ground into powder, matcha is reowned for its abundant antioxidants. When consumed, it delivers a higher caffeine content compared to regular green tea, usually less than a typical cup of coffee, as you injest the entire tea leaf.</p>
