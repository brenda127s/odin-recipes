    <p>You may have consumed cold brewed coffee at a nearby cafe or purchased it in ready-to-go containers at the store for ultimate convenience. Yet, once you discover how effortlessly you can draft it at home, you'll ponder why you haven't been brewing it yourself all this time.</p>
    <h2>What is cold brew coffee</h2>
    <p>Cold brew coffee remians cool throughout its preparation. Unlike the quick-brewing methods taking just a few minutes, cold brew involves a slow 12 to 15 hour steeping process. This results in a less acidic and bitter coffee, offering a sweeter, fuller-bodied flavor that truly excels when it comes to iced coffee.</p>
