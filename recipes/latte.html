    <p>What could be more revitalizing than a chilled latte? It's no surprise that this espresso beverage enjoys widespread popularity. The harmonious blend of robust coffee, subtle sweetness, and velvety frothed milk is truly delightful. You don't have to rush to your preferred coffee spot for this treat, it's a breeze to whip up at home! There's nothing more satisfying than an iced latte on warm summer afternoons (or any time, for that matter).</p>
    <h2> What exactly is an iced latte?</h2>
    <p>An iced latte compromises espresso, milk, and a sweetener if desired. The milk is typically frothed to replicate the steamed milk found in a regular latte. Now, how does it differ from iced coffee? Iced coffee is made with brewed coffee and can include milk if desired.
